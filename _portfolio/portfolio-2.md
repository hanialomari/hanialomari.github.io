## Project Overview
Developed and deployed a real-time, multi-view surgical instrument classification system capable of identifying 95 different instrument types with high accuracy. This system is currently deployed in hospital settings and achieved a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 81.7. This work was published at **FGVC @ CVPR 2025**.

## Key Contributions
- Built ultra-fine-grained classification system handling **95 surgical instrument types**
- Implemented real-time inference pipeline for multi-view camera systems
- Achieved high classification accuracy suitable for clinical deployment
- Conducted user studies resulting in **SUS score of 81.7** (above industry "good" threshold of 68)

## Technical Approach
- **Architecture:** Fine-grained CNN architectures optimized for real-time inference
- **Multi-view Fusion:** Aggregation strategies combining information from multiple camera angles
- **Training:** Transfer learning with domain-specific data augmentation
- **Deployment:** Optimized inference pipeline with low latency requirements
- **Framework:** PyTorch, OpenCV, TensorRT for optimization

## Impact
This system supports surgical workflow optimization, inventory management, and training applications. Real-world deployment demonstrates practical applicability of computer vision research in healthcare settings.
