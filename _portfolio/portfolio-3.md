## Project Overview
Led the creation of **So2al-wa-Gwab**, a comprehensive Arabic question-answering dataset containing 10,000 question-answer pairs. This project addressed the critical gap in Arabic NLP resources by developing automated data collection pipelines, annotation workflows, and rigorous quality control processes.

## Key Contributions
- Designed and implemented **10K-question Arabic QA dataset** with full annotation pipeline
- Developed automated web scraping system with error handling and data validation
- Created three-stage quality control process ensuring annotation consistency
- Benchmarked span-extraction models across **7 Arabic QA datasets** using EM and F1 metrics
- Demonstrated transformer model advantages over traditional baselines for Arabic text

## Technical Approach
- **Data Collection:** Automated web scraping with custom parsers for Arabic content
- **Annotation Pipeline:** Multi-stage workflow with inter-annotator agreement checks
- **Quality Control:** Three-tier validation process (automated, expert review, cross-validation)
- **Modeling:** BERT-based models fine-tuned for Arabic span extraction
- **Evaluation:** Comprehensive benchmarking using Exact Match and F1 scores
- **Tools:** Python, spaCy, Transformers, custom annotation interfaces

## Dataset Statistics
- **Size:** 10,000 question-answer pairs
- **Language:** Modern Standard Arabic
- **Domains:** Multiple domains for diverse coverage
- **Quality Metrics:** High inter-annotator agreement, validated answer spans

## Impact
