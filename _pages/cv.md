## Open to Opportunities

I am actively seeking **research internships** and **collaboration opportunities** in AI/ML, particularly in:
- Multimodal AI and Vision-Language Models
- Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision
- Cross-Modal Retrieval and RAG Systems
- Deep Learning and Neural Architecture Design

**Available:** Summer 2025 and beyond
**Contact:** [hani@vt.edu](mailto:hani@vt.edu) | [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/hanialomari) | [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ft_qTcwAAAAJ&hl=en)

## Research Summary
I specialize in multimodal learning at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with focus on vision-language models and cross-modal retrieval. My research develops diverse, semantically aligned representations using multi-embedding strategies to capture non-literal and abstract relationships across image, text, video, and audio. I work on structured knowledge extraction and grounded reasoning for interpretable VLMs, supported by novel benchmarks and evaluation frameworks. This work has resulted in publications at premier venues including **ACL 2025 (Main)**, **NeurIPS 2024**, and **CVPR 2025**.
