## Research Statement
My work lies at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with primary focus on multimodal learning and vision-language models. I develop diverse, semantically aligned representations for cross-modal retrieval across image, text, video, and audio using multi-embedding strategies to capture non-literal and abstract relationships. I work on structured knowledge and grounded reasoning for interpretable vision-language models, supported by new benchmarks and evaluation pipelines. This research has led to publications at top-tier venues such as ACL 2025.

## Research Experience
- **Research Assistant**, Virginia Tech (Mar 2023 -- Present)  
  - Led diversity-aware image-text retrieval using maximal matching objectives and multi-embedding strategies, improving performance by up to 7.1% and resulting in an ACL 2025 publication.  
  - Built a diversification pipeline that generates facet-specific captions with vision-language models, expanding beyond COCO and Flickr30k coverage.  
  - Leading generative room-geometry work that conditions on room-impulse responses (RIRs) to reconstruct layouts from line-segment representations.  
  - Collaborated with Columbia University on ENTER and JourneyBench, contributing modeling, annotation, and evaluation for NeurIPS 2024 publications.  
  - Supported hospital deployment of a real-time, multi-view surgical instrument classifier covering 95 instrument types with high accuracy and SUS 81.7.
- **Research Assistant**, Jordan University of Science and Technology (Feb 2020 -- Nov 2022)  
  - Created So2al-wa-Gwab, a 10K-question Arabic QA dataset with scripted scraping, annotation workflow design, and three-stage quality control.  
  - Benchmarked span-extraction models across seven Arabic QA datasets using EM and F1, demonstrating transformer gains over baselines.  
  - Led an Arabic humor detection project with end-to-end NLP pipelines and ranked 7/45 (top ~15%) in shared-task competition results.  
  - Conducted a systematic literature review on Arabic QA extraction to highlight translation dependencies and inform dataset design.
- **Research Assistant (Intern)**, Jordan University of Science and Technology (Jun 2019 -- Aug 2019)  
  - Built and debugged deep learning pipelines with TensorFlow and spaCy for propaganda and emotion detection, ranking 7/26 (top 27%) in the NLP4IF 2019 SLC track.
