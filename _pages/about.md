I build retrieval that understands **images, text, video, and sound** -- not just the literal match. I'm a Ph.D. researcher at Virginia Tech's Sanghani Center working on multimodal learning with [Dr. Chris Thomas](https://people.cs.vt.edu/chris/). My work combines vision-language models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and ranking systems to surface the meaningful, often unexpected connections across modalities.

### What I focus on
- **Multi-prompt embeddings** that generate many small "views" of meaning, so search stays rich, fair, and resilient against collapse.  
- **Two-stage retrieval pipelines** that pair lightweight retrievers with cross-modal rerankers and VLM "readers" for grounded reasoning.  
- **Diversity-aware retrieval** that captures literal, figurative, emotional, abstract, and cultural cues rather than a single one-size vector.

### Why it matters
We live in a semantically diverse era where creativity, safety, and accessibility depend on bridging visual, textual, and auditory understanding. Multimodal systems must retrieve more than the "closest" item--they must retrieve what matters. My research builds new objectives, evaluation pipelines, and datasets so retrieval can support idioms, metaphors, cultural nuance, and underrepresented perspectives.

### Now
- Training a VLM-based retriever with a cross-modal reranker, and multi-prompt-embedding based to guide the diversity.   
- Building a RAG workflow that treats the VLM as a "reader" and keeps factual grounding.  
- Exploring room-impulse responses (RIRs) for spatial cues in generative scene understanding.
